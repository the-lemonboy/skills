<!-- DO NOT IGNORE THE TEMPLATE!

Thank you for contributing!

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:

- Read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/sxzz/contribute).
- Check that there isn't already a PR that solves the problem the same way to avoid creating a duplicate.
- Provide a description in this PR that addresses **what** the PR is solving, or reference the issue that it solves (e.g. `fixes #123`).
- Ideally, include relevant tests that fail without this PR but pass with it.

Note: Since this project is not one that AI currently excels at, we do not accept Vibe coding or AI-generated core code (documentation excluded) unless it has been thoroughly reviewed line by line by a human. Please do not submit AI-generated pull requests directly, as this increases the workload for maintainers.
