    "Step 1: Run wordpress-router to classify repo kind",
    "Step 2: Run wp-project-triage to detect tooling (Composer/PHPStan present)",
    "Step 3: Route to wp-phpstan skill",
    "Step 4: Discover how PHPStan is invoked (composer scripts vs vendor/bin/phpstan)",
    "Step 5: Locate phpstan.neon/phpstan.neon.dist and any baseline",
    "Step 6: Prefer stubs (php-stubs/wordpress-stubs, php-stubs/woocommerce-stubs) or equivalent autoloading",
    "Step 7: If the dependency cannot be analyzed, add a targeted ignoreErrors pattern for WC_",
