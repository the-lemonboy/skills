# Principles

- Prefer small, composable skills over a single "mega-skill".
- Keep `SKILL.md` bodies short; move depth into `references/`.
- Bundle deterministic checks as scripts when reliability matters.
- Treat upstream docs as canonical; store agent-first checklists and decision trees.
- Every new skill must include at least one eval scenario under `eval/scenarios/`.
