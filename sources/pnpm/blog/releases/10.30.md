pnpm 10.30 redesigns `pnpm why` to show a reverse dependency tree, making it much easier to understand why a package is installed.

### Minor Changes

#### Reverse Dependency Tree in `pnpm why`

`pnpm why` now shows a reverse dependency tree. The searched package appears at the root with its dependents as branches, walking back to workspace roots. This replaces the previous forward-tree output which was noisy and hard to read for deeply nested dependencies.

### Patch Changes

- Optimize `pnpm why` and `pnpm list` performance in workspaces with many importers by sharing the dependency graph and materialization cache across all importers instead of rebuilding them independently for each one [#10596](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10596).
