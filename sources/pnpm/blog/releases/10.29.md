pnpm 10.29 adds `catalog:` protocol support to `pnpm dlx`, allows configuring `auditLevel` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, supports a bare `workspace:` specifier, and includes several bug fixes.

### Minor Changes

#### `catalog:` Protocol in `pnpm dlx`

The `pnpm dlx` / `pnpx` command now supports the `catalog:` protocol, allowing you to reference versions defined in your workspace catalogs:

```sh
pnpm dlx shx@catalog:
```

#### `auditLevel` Setting

`auditLevel` can now be configured in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file, so you don't need to pass `--audit-level` on every `pnpm audit` invocation [#10540](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10540):

```yaml title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
auditLevel: high
```

#### Bare `workspace:` Protocol

A bare `workspace:` specifier without a version range is now supported. It is treated as `workspace:*` and resolves to the concrete version during publish [#10436](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10436):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "foo": "workspace:"
  }
}
```

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an out-of-memory error in `pnpm list` (and `pnpm why`) on large dependency graphs by replacing the recursive tree builder with a two-phase approach: a BFS dependency graph followed by cached tree materialization. Duplicate subtrees are now deduplicated in the output [#10586](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10586).
- Fixed `allowBuilds` not working when set via `.pnpmfile.cjs` [#10516](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10516).
- When `enableGlobalVirtualStore` is set, `pnpm deploy` now ignores it and always creates a localized virtual store within the deploy directory to keep it self-contained.
- Fixed `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` not being respected by `pnpm dlx` [#10338](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10338).
- Fixed `pnpm list --json` returning incorrect paths when using global virtual store [#10187](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10187).
- Fixed `pnpm store path` and `pnpm store status` using workspace root for path resolution when `storeDir` is relative [#10290](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10290).
- Fixed `catalogMode: strict` writing the literal string `catalog:` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead of the resolved version specifier when re-adding an existing catalog dependency [#10176](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10176).
- Skip local `file:` protocol dependencies during `pnpm fetch`, fixing Docker builds when local directory dependencies are not available [#10460](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10460).
- Fixed `pnpm audit --json` to respect the `--audit-level` setting for both exit code and output filtering [#10540](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10540).
- Updated `tar` to version 7.5.7 to fix a security vulnerability ([CVE-2026-24842](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24842)).
- Fixed `pnpm audit --fix` replacing reference overrides (e.g. `$foo`) with concrete versions [#10325](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10325).
- Fixed `shamefullyHoist` set via `updateConfig` in `.pnpmfile.cjs` not being converted to `publicHoistPattern` [#10271](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10271).
- `pnpm help` now correctly reports if the currently running pnpm CLI is bundled with Node.js [#10561](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10561).
- Added a warning when the current directory contains the PATH delimiter character, which can break `node_modules/.bin` path injection [#10457](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10457).
- Fixed the documentation URL shown in `pnpm completion --help` to point to the correct page [#10281](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10281).
