Shows all packages that depend on the specified package.

The output is a reverse dependency tree: the searched package appears at the root, with its dependents as branches, walking back to workspace roots.

Duplicate subtrees are deduplicated in the output and shown as "deduped".

## Options

### --recursive, -r

Show the dependency tree for the specified package on every package in
subdirectories or on every workspace package when executed inside a workspace.

### --json

Show information in JSON format.

### --long

Show verbose output.

### --parseable

Show parseable output instead of tree view.

### --global, -g

List packages in the global install directory instead of in the current project.

### --prod, -P

Only display the dependency tree for packages in `dependencies`.

### --dev, -D

Only display the dependency tree for packages in `devDependencies`.

### --depth &lt;number\>

Display only dependencies within a specific depth.

### --only-projects

Display only dependencies that are also projects within the workspace.

### --exclude-peers

Exclude peer dependencies from the results (but dependencies of peer dependencies are not ignored).

### --filter &lt;package_selector\>
